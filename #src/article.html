                                        Our studio has been called «Nanobot» not without reason. It was our natural
                                        name.
                                    </q>

                                    <p>
                                        For many years, we have been fascinated with nanotechnology and nanorobots or
                                        saying simply nanobots. A nanobot is a tiny device designed to perform specific
                                        or sometimes precise tasks at 1-100 nm nanoscale dimensions. To give a practical
                                        idea of the nanoscale, a ribosome is approximately 30 nanometers, an antibody is
                                        about 10 nanometers, and a hemoglobin molecule is about 5 nanometers.
                                    </p>

                                    <q>
                                        The word “nano” originates from the Greek word “dwarf.”
                                    </q>
                                    <p>
                                        The concept of nanotechnology was first elaborated in 1959 by Richard Feynman, a
                                        Nobel Prize-winning physicist, in a lecture titled, “There’s plenty of room at
                                        the bottom.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        However, there has been significant progress in nanotechnology since the early
                                        ideas of Feynman.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We did our first project about nanobots more than 12 years ago. It was about a
                                        DNA-repair nanorobot that was supposed to cure genetic defects in DNA by gene
                                        replacement. Its concept might look futuristic, but the general idea is still
                                        real.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The nanobot is supposed to scan nucleotides, seek for damaged fragments, remove
                                        invalid fragments, and finally repair the DNA. Gene therapy is a new and rapidly
                                        developing area, and maybe one day, nanobots will play a significant role.
                                    </p>

                                    <figure>
                                        <img src="img/photo/article-img-3.jpg" alt="">
                                    </figure>
                                    <p>
                                        Another idea about future technologies is an antibacterial treatment with
                                        nanobots. Let’s imagine a nanobot that can get inside bacteria and heat it to
                                        death, not harming any other cells. What does it look like in your mind? Our
                                        version of the antibacterial nanobot is a sphere with retractable heating
                                        elements, which becomes injected in case of bacterial presence.
                                    </p>
                                    <figure>

                                        Some nanobots are designed to kill bacteria, but sometimes the bacteria
                                        themselves are the inspiration for nanobots’ development.
                                    </q>
                                    <p>
                                        For example, many bacteria possess chemical rotors that enable them to power
                                        flagella or cilia, providing corkscrew or beading motions.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Such propulsion mechanism has inspired rotating synthetic microrobots, where
                                        synthetic helical microstructures, flexible filaments, or tumblers rotate in
                                        axis to that of a bacterial flagellum.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        More than that, some magnetotactic bacteria with attached drug-containing
                                        nanoliposomes are used for drug delivery.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Red devil doxorubicin is an intravenous cancer medicine with a bright, clear
                                        color, which gave it its nickname. In addition to heart toxicity, nausea and
                                        vomiting, and hair loss, doxorubicin can cause harsh side effects. It would be
                                        wonderful if we could reduce these adverse effects and deliver the drugs
                                        directly to individual cells...
                                    </p>
                                    <q>
                                        Nanobots could help! For instance, a robot-nanocarrier with a diameter of 50 to
                                        120 nanometers could be used.
                                    </q>
                                    <p>
                                        The nanobot is a mesoporous silica sphere stuffed with doxorubicin molecules.
                                        The nanocarrier is half-covered with a thin layer of gold, achieving efficient
                                        propulsion under near-infrared irradiation. It can move at an ultrafast speed,
                                        up to 950 body lengths per second. In addition, the nanocarrier has excellent
                                        cell and tissue penetrability and on-off controlled release ability based on the
                                        surrounding environment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As a result, the nanobot can penetrate deep into the tumor cell by cell,
                                        reducing drug side effects.
                                    </p>

                                            It would be great if surgeons had micro or nanosurgical tools that could penetrate or retrieve cellular tissues directly from remote locations within the body. We intend to demonstrate a star-shaped microgripper with a size of 700*m today.

                                        These tiny medical devices are made of ferromagnetic materials and can be precisely manipulated using a magnet from a distance of up to 10 cm. Once the robot reaches a necessary location, it becomes actuated by mechanical, electrical, or chemical signals, and the microgripper closes, trapping a cell inside.
